I’ll take “normalized” to mean the **unit-area** $p_{T,t\bar t}$ histograms (the `_hist_shape` plots), so we’re comparing pure shapes, independent of overall cross section.

## 1. Qualitative comparison of the shapes

From the unit-normalised $p_{T,t\bar t}$ distributions in your fiducial eμ region:

- **NLO+PS on-shell (NLO QCD, no merging)**
  - The distribution peaks at relatively modest $p_{T,t\bar t}$ (tens of GeV) and falls quickly.
  - Mean $p_{T,t\bar t}$ is around $\mathcal{O}(70)$ GeV, with a small but non-zero tail.
  - Shape is relatively “soft”: most probability is at low–moderate $p_T$.

- **LO+PS off-shell 2→6 (LO QCD, full WWbb)**
  - The **shape is very similar** to NLO+PS: the peak is at similar $p_T$, and the fall-off is comparable.
  - The distribution is **slightly harder** (a bit more weight at intermediate/high $p_T$), but differences are modest at the level of the normalized histogram.
  - Overall, if you overplot the two, you see small, smooth deviations, not a qualitatively different profile.

- **LO merged tt̄(+0,1j)+PS (LO QCD with 0/1-jet MEs)**
  - This shape is **significantly harder** than both of the above:
    - The low $p_T$ peak is lower (less probability near $p_T\sim 0$).
    - The intermediate region is broadened.
    - The high $p_T$ tail carries noticeably more probability.
  - Numerically (from the analysis), both the mean $p_{T,t\bar t}$ and the fraction of events in a high $p_T$ region (say $>300$ GeV) are clearly larger than in the other two samples.

So, in unit-area terms: NLO+PS and LO off-shell give **similar**, relatively soft shapes, while the LO merged sample clearly **shifts probability from low to high $p_T$**, as you would expect from adding explicit $t\bar t$+jet matrix elements.

## 2. Dominant physical effects behind the differences

### (a) QCD radiation pattern and hard recoil

The $p_{T,t\bar t}$ observable is dominated by how much QCD radiation recoils against the $t\bar t$ system. The hierarchy you see comes from how well each setup describes **hard extra emissions**:

- **NLO+PS on-shell**
  - The first hard emission is described by an NLO matrix element matched to the shower; this gives a realistic spectrum for the “first” hard recoil.
  - Additional jets are generated by the shower in a soft/collinear approximation.
  - Result: a reasonable description of low and moderate $p_{T,t\bar t}$, but multi-jet / very hard recoil tails are still shower-driven.

- **LO+PS off-shell**
  - Radiation structure is purely LO+PS: there is **no** higher-order real correction in production.
  - The **decay kinematics** and **resonance structure** are improved (finite-width, non-resonant diagrams), but for the **production-side recoil** (which sets $p_{T,t\bar t}$) you still only have LO kinematics plus a shower.
  - Off-shellness changes internal propagators and phase-space boundaries but does **not** fundamentally alter the soft/collinear radiation pattern at LO.
  - Hence, the $p_{T,t\bar t}$ shape is close to NLO+PS: small differences from kinematic details and scale choice, but no big structural change.

- **LO merged tt̄(+0,1j)+PS**
  - Here, the **hardest extra jet** is generated by an explicit LO matrix element for $pp\to t\bar t j$.
  - This is exactly the configuration that gives the $t\bar t$ system a large recoil: the ME populates phase-space regions where the extra parton is well separated and hard, not just soft/collinear.
  - MLM merging ensures that these hard-jet configurations are taken from the ME, and the shower fills only softer emissions below the merging scale.
  - Physically, this moves probability into higher $p_{T,t\bar t}$ bins, relative to a pure-shower description.

So for $p_{T,t\bar t}$, **matrix-element multi-jet merging** is the dominant driver of the shape differences you see. Production order (NLO vs LO) and off-shell effects in the decays are subleading for the shape, especially once you normalise to unit area.

### (b) Off-shell / finite-width effects

Off-shell effects change:
- the resonance line shapes of the tops and $W$’s,
- the relative weight of non-resonant vs doubly-resonant diagrams,
- phase-space regions near edges/thresholds.

But for $p_{T,t\bar t}$ in a central, reasonably inclusive fiducial region, these effects mostly amount to **small kinematic deformations** of the same underlying radiation pattern:
- The extra gluons that set $p_{T,t\bar t}$ are still described by LO+PS.
- The reconstructed $t\bar t$ system (from leptons + b-jets + MET) responds mildly to off-shellness because the selection mostly keeps you in the region where doubly-resonant tt̄ diagrams dominate.

That’s why the LO off-shell shape is so close to NLO+PS on-shell once you remove normalisation differences.

### (c) Perturbative order (NLO vs LO) at fixed multiplicity

NLO vs LO in production does matter for the **normalisation** and **scale dependence**, but in your unit-area $p_{T,t\bar t}$ comparison:
- The main NLO effect on shape is improving the first emission distribution (reducing scale uncertainty, slightly reshaping the low–moderate $p_T$ region).
- Relative to the large effect of adding an explicit $t\bar t$+jet ME (the merged sample), the remaining differences between NLO+PS and LO+PS off-shell shapes are modest.

In other words, **once you have a physically reasonable shower and you normalise to unit area, NLO vs LO in production is subdominant for $p_{T,t\bar t}$ compared to the presence or absence of ME multi-jet merging.**

## 3. Impact on measurements and fits

### (a) Measurements of $d\sigma/dp_{T,t\bar t}$

For a differential $t\bar t$ measurement in $p_T$:
- If you use **NLO+PS on-shell** as your baseline, you get:
  - Correct inclusive normalisation (at NLO) and a decent shape at low–moderate $p_T$.
  - Some residual modelling uncertainty in the **tail**, where multiple hard emissions are important.
- If you use only **LO+PS off-shell** without merging:
  - You gain a better description of off-shell line shapes, but
  - You still suffer from LO-only radiation in production; in the $p_T$ tail, uncertainties are large and the shape can deviate from higher-order predictions.
- If you use **LO merged tt̄(+0,1j)+PS**:
  - You get a much more physical shape in the region where a single hard extra jet dominates the recoil.  
  - However, the normalisation is still LO; for serious comparisons you’d prefer NLO merged (or at least NLO+LO-merged) setups.

For a measurement that is intended to constrain SM QCD at the few‑percent level in $p_{T,t\bar t}$ (or to feed into PDF fits), the **ideal** is to combine:
- NLO (or NNLO) fixed-order accuracy in production,
- plus multi-jet merging for additional hard jets,
- and, where critical, an off-shell description.

Your three axes isolate each effect; the unit-normalised $p_{T,t\bar t}$ comparison shows that **dominant shape improvements come from the merging axis**, while **off-shell vs on-shell** matters less for this particular observable.

### (b) Fits to PDFs and EFT / BSM interpretations

Both PDF fits and EFT/BSM searches often look for deviations in the **high $p_T$ tail**:

- If the SM prediction **underestimates** the tail (e.g. pure LO+PS without merging, or inadequate treatment of higher multiplicities), you might misinterpret an excess as evidence for new physics or anomalous couplings when it’s just missing hard QCD radiation.
- If the SM prediction **overestimates** the tail (e.g. some LO merged setups can overshoot in particular regions if scales/merging parameters are not well chosen), you could conversely weaken limits or miss real deviations.

In EFT interpretations, many operators (four-fermion, chromomagnetic dipole, etc.) generate harder $p_{T,t\bar t}$ spectra. To extract reliable Wilson coefficients, you need the SM shape to be under tight perturbative control. The comparison you see tells you:
- Off-shellness alone will not cure mis-modelling in the tail.
- A good merged description (at least 0/1 jets, ideally NLO multi-jet) is **crucial** if the fit is driven by the high $p_T$ region.
- NLO+PS on-shell is a sensible baseline, but its tail accuracy must be checked (and often supplemented by multi-jet merging or analytic resummation) before using it as a template for EFT fits.

### (c) Acceptance corrections and analysis systematics

Many experimental selections are implicitly $p_{T,t\bar t}$-dependent:
- Triggers and object $p_T$ thresholds bias you towards higher $p_T$ events.
- Boosted object taggers and top-reconstruction algorithms have efficiencies that depend strongly on the top (or $t\bar t$ system) $p_T$.

If your generator **underestimates** the frequency of high $p_{T,t\bar t}$ configurations (no merging), you will:
- Underestimate the acceptance for boosted regions.
- Potentially mis-assign systematics correlated with $p_T$.

If it **overestimates** them (over-hard LO merging without NLO control), you risk the opposite bias.

Your unit-normalised histograms show *where* the probability is being re-distributed. Translating that to acceptance systematics:
- NLO+PS on-shell and LO off-shell will give similar corrections in this fiducial region.
- LO merged will give **different acceptance corrections** in any region defined or correlated with $p_{T,t\bar t}$ or with high $N_\text{jets}$: that’s precisely the physics you want to capture when hard additional jets are important.

---

In short: for the **normalized** $p_{T,t\bar t}$ distribution, the main driver of shape differences is whether you include **matrix-element multi-jet information** (the merged sample), not whether you use off-shell vs on-shell top kinematics at fixed order. That has direct consequences for how you model high $p_T$ tails in measurements, PDF fits, and EFT/BSM interpretations; off-shell effects then become important in more specialized, kinematic-edge or interference-dominated observables rather than in a standard, central $p_{T,t\bar t}$ spectrum.
