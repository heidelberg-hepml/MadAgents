## Acknowledgements and Attribution

To test and demonstrate the capabilities of MadAgents, we use an excerpt from the paper

The excerpt is used purely as input to the agent, without modification of its technical content.
All credit for the workflow design and physics discussion belongs to the original authors.

We thank the authors for making their work publicly available and for providing a clear,
well-structured example that is well suited for demonstrating autonomous agentic analysis workflows.
